# Digi-Lib, a digital library
{: .fs-9 }

Digi-Lib is a place where past notes are stored, allowing me to more reliably access and view my notes. This is also a place where others can view and learn from my past experiences.

## About Digi-Lib
Digi-Lib is built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com){:target="_blank"} using ["Just the Docs"](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/){:target="_blank"} theme. Github then compiles the pages adn publishes it to Github Pages.
## Who am I?

I am Wen Kang, currently a Year 2 Polytechnic student taking a Diploma in Information Technology. I regularly make my own notes during and after lessons. Through this website, I hope that these resources would be useful long after I have used them.
