## About MyNotes
MyNotes is built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) using ["Just the Docs"](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/) theme. Github then compiles the pages adn publishes it to Github Pages.
## Who am I?

I am Wen Kang, currently a Year 2 Polytechnic student taking a Diploma in Information Technology. I regularly make my own notes during and after lessons. Through this website, I hope that these resources would be useful long after I have used them.
